✨ Codedex Summer Hackathon 2024 ✨

💌 Brooklyn Stoop Sale 💌 
Create an interactive invitation to a Brooklyn Stoop Sale using HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

Criteria:

- ▶️ Make it interactive (Music? Animation? Be creative!!)
- 🗓️ Date & time (make this up!)
- 📍 Place with a map API (2nd Pl. and Court St)
- 🔗 Shareability
- ⭐️ VIBES: good quality, tasteful, and awesome things

🛍️ Here are some of the things we’ll be selling: clothes, home goods, shoes, tchotchkes -- things that can be set up on a table and one clothing rack on a corner in Brooklyn, NY lol

For this project, I used Next.js, tailwind, and project IDX to create an online, interactive invitation to a stoop sale in Brooklyn!

I used Next.js as I am more comfortable using this than WIX, and wanted to focus more on learning things like map APIs and animations. I used tailwind because it's my favourite and so much quicker than plain old CSS, and I used Project IDX (basically vscode in a browser), because I have a very old laptop lol.

✨ I had a play around with adding some fun hover and active animations to the images and buttons

✨ I used the Leaflet API to showcase the event location on a map (and also what3words)

✨I used the NPM package 'next-share' to allow the user to share the stoop sale website on Facebook, X, and WhatsApp!

✨I used tailwind breakpoints to make the app responsive on mobile and desktop :D

✨ There is some metadata on the layout.js file as well :D

I had so much fun making this project, and this is the first time I have used a map API and social media buttons so I'm super happy I have learned how to make those :D

The overall vibes I was going for was New York/messenger pigeon/torn paper/playful vibes. If I had more time I would have added a lot more images, text, and music; and also tried using an animation library like anime.js or GSAP.

The app is hosted on vercel here: https://brooklyn-stoop-sale.vercel.app/
